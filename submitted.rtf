Week 4\

Current concept I'm shooting for might be a card matching game.  Flip over two cards to see if they match.  Flip till you get them all, or three strikes and you're out!\
\
Got it all in, huzzah!  Added in that visual feedback we spoke about - " \uc0\u8730  " cards and a " Hot Streak! "\
You'll also see the Animation was added in as well, with flipping cards!  They flip forward and backward decently, more frames would have made it smoother\'85 BUT totally cool that I made the Card class in charge of flipping itself as well.  Handier and handier that the Cards got refactored. :)\
